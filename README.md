# ChAMPDemos
This repository contains some demos for using ChAMP R package to analysis illumina 450K or EPIC methylation array.

I used [ChAMP](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChAMP.html) package to process these data sets and recorded all result in the Markdown document, also included some plots. User who have no idea how to use ChAMP could use this document as instruction as well.

More demos would be included in the future. These demo markdown file could be regarded as supplementary of vignette of ChAMP.

If you have any question and suggestion to ChAMP, please email to champ450K@gmail.com or tianyuan1991hit@gmail.com
